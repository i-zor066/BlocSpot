# BlocSpot
An Android application, which combines Yelp search results with GeoFences to create a location-aware Point-of-Interest tracker. Users can search Yelp, to save points of interest, view them on a map or on a list and be notified when they approach them (built as a part of Bloc.io's Android Development Apprenticeship ).
